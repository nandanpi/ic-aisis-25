                          social, and economic challenges, sustainability has
                          become an urgent global priority. From climate change
                          and resource depletion to public health crises and
                          urban overpopulation, the complexity of today&apos;s
                          problems demands innovative, data-driven solutions.
                          Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its powerful
                          capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition,
                          automation, and decision-making, holds immense
                          potential to transform how we approach sustainable
                          development.
